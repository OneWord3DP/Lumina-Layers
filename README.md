## 📖 Overview

**Lumina-Layers** bridges the gap between digital pixels and physical filaments.

Traditional multi-color relief tools rely on theoretical "Transmission Distance" (TD) values, which often fail due to filament batch variance, nozzle temperature, or slicer logic. Lumina-Layers uses a **Closed-Loop Calibration System**. By scanning a physically printed color matrix, it builds a "Ground Truth" Look-Up Table (LUT) specific to your printer hardware, ensuring accurate color reproduction for pixel art and relief models.

---

## 🔄 The Closed-Loop Workflow

**Lumina Studio v1.2** integrates three specialized modules into a unified application:

### 📐 Module 1: Calibration Generator
Generates a precision calibration board to physically test filament mixing.

- **1024-Color Matrix**: Full permutation of 4 base filaments across 5 layers (0.4mm).
- **Dual Color Modes**: Supports both **CMYW** (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow/White) and **RYBW** (Red/Yellow/Blue/White).
- **Face-Down Optimization**: Prints the viewing surface directly on the build plate for a smooth finish.
- **Solid Backing**: Automatically generates a 1.6mm opaque backing to ensure color consistency and structural rigidity.
- **Anti-Overlap Geometry**: Applies 0.02mm micro-shrinkage to voxels to prevent slicer line-width conflicts.

### 🎨 Module 2: Color Extractor
Digitizes the physical reality of your printer.

- **Computer Vision**: Auto-aligns the grid using perspective warp and lens distortion correction.
- **Mode-Aware Alignment**: Corner markers follow the correct color sequence based on your selected mode (CMYW vs RYBW).
- **Digital Twin**: Extracts RGB values from the print and generates a `.npy` LUT file.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Interactive probe tools allow you to manually verify and correct specific color block readings (e.g., removing glare/shadows).

### 💎 Module 3: Image Converter
Converts images into printable 3D models using the calibrated data.

- **KD-Tree Color Matching**: Maps image pixels to the actual printable colors found in your LUT.
- **Live 3D Preview**: Interactive WebGL preview with true matched colors - rotate, zoom, and inspect before printing.
- **Structure Options**: Double-sided (keychain) or Single-sided (relief) modes.
- **Smart Background Removal**: Automatic transparency detection with adjustable tolerance.
- **Correct 3MF Naming**: Objects are named by color (e.g., "Cyan", "Magenta") instead of "geometry_0" for easy slicer identification.

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Foundation ✅ **COMPLETE**
> Target: Pixel Art & Simple Graphics.

- ✅ Fixed CMYW/RYBW mixing
- ✅ Integer-based "Slab" geometry
- ✅ Solid Backing generation
- ✅ Closed-loop calibration system
- ✅ Live 3D preview with true colors

### Phase 2: Manga Mode (Monochrome) 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**

- Tech: Simulating screen tones (Ben-Day dots).

### Phase 3: Full-Color Photo Engine
> Target: Photographs, Anime illustrations.

- Logic: Dynamic Palette Support (4/6/8 colors).
- Tech:
  - Advanced Dithering algorithms (Floyd-Steinberg/Atkinson) to simulate gradients.
  - LAB Color Space integration for better perceptual matching.

### Phase 4: Extended Color Modes
> Target: Professional multi-material printing.

## 🛠️ Installation

**Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MOVIBALE/Lumina-Layers.git
cd Lumina-Layers
```

**Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Quick Start
```bash
python LuminaStudio.py
```
This launches the web interface with all three modules in tabs.

---

### Step 1: Generate Calibration Board

1. Open the **📐 Calibration** tab
2. Select your color mode:
   - **RYBW** (Red/Yellow/Blue/White) - Traditional primaries
   - **CMYW** (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow/White) - Print colors, wider gamut
3. Adjust block size (default: 5mm) and gap (default: 0.82mm)
4. Click **Generate** and download the `.3mf` file

**Print Settings:**
- Layer height: 0.08mm (color layers), backing can use 0.2mm
- Filament slots must match your selected mode

| Mode | Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Slot 3 | Slot 4 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| RYBW | White | Red | Yellow | Blue |
| CMYW | White | Cyan | Magenta | Yellow |

---

### Step 2: Extract Colors

1. Print the calibration board and photograph it (face-up, even lighting)
2. Open the **🎨 Color Extractor** tab
3. **Select the same color mode** as your calibration board
4. Upload your photo
5. Click the four corner blocks in order:

| Mode | Corner 1 (TL) | Corner 2 (TR) | Corner 3 (BR) | Corner 4 (BL) |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| RYBW | ⬜ White | 🟥 Red | 🟦 Blue | 🟨 Yellow |
| CMYW | ⬜ White | 🔵 Cyan | 🟣 Magenta | 🟨 Yellow |

6. Adjust correction sliders if needed
7. Click **Extract** and download `my_printer_lut.npy`

---

### Step 3: Convert Image

1. Open the **💎 Image Converter** tab
2. Upload your `.npy` LUT file
3. Upload your image (pixel art works best)
4. **Select the same color mode** as your LUT
5. Choose structure type:
   - **Double-sided** - For keychains (image on both sides)
   - **Single-sided** - For relief/lithophane style
6. Click **Generate**
7. Preview in the interactive 3D viewer
8. Download the `.3mf` file
